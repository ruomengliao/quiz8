## **Part 1: Imaging Technique Inspiration (Pixel Art Style)**

I have chosen the pixel art style as the source of inspiration for my assignment. This style was originally used in classic 8-bit and 16-bit games such as *Super Mario* and *The Legend of Zelda*. It is characterized by creating complex images using simple pixel blocks. This style is particularly well-suited for implementation through code, as it is grid-based, and both shapes and colors are easy to control. I want to apply this retro visual style to my work because it not only evokes a sense of nostalgia but also adds fun and visual effects to the animation through the transformation of blocks. This aligns well with the assignmentâ€™s requirement to represent artwork through code.

## **Part 2: Coding Technique Exploration (Implementation of Pixel Art Style)**

To implement the pixel art style, I chose to use the grid drawing technique in p5.js. This technique divides the canvas into a series of small pixel blocks, allowing us to control the color and position of each pixel individually through code. p5.js provides a highly flexible `rect()` function, which, combined with a `for` loop, can easily generate a pixel-style grid. This technique helps me precisely control the components of the image to align with the classic pixel art style, and by altering the color or size, I can achieve animation effects.
